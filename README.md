## 1. Introduction to AI and Machine Learning 
### 1.1 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of building systems that perform tasks which, if done by 
humans, would be considered to require intelligence.
#### Key distinctions:
‚Ä¢ Narrow (or applied) AI: Systems designed for a specific task (e.g., spam detection, image 
recognition). This is what exists today.

‚Ä¢ General AI (AGI): Hypothetical systems with broad, human-level cognitive abilities (not 
yet achieved).

### 1.2 What is Machine Learning (ML) and how it relates to AI
Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that focuses on algorithms that improve automatically 
through experience (data).
Core idea: instead of writing rules by hand, feed data and let the model learn patterns.
#### Relationship:
‚Ä¢ AI = broad objective (intelligent behaviour).

‚Ä¢ ML = practical approach using data-driven models.

‚Ä¢ Deep Learning (DL) = subset of ML that uses large neural networks (many layers) to learn 
complex patterns

### 1.3 Quick historical milestones 
‚Ä¢ 1956: ‚ÄúAI‚Äù term coined at Dartmouth workshop. Early symbolic approaches.

‚Ä¢ 1960s‚Äì1980s: Rule-based systems and expert systems dominated.

‚Ä¢ 1990s: Statistical learning, SVMs, kernel methods.

‚Ä¢ 2012: Deep learning breakthrough (AlexNet for image recognition); resurgence due to 
data + GPUs.

‚Ä¢ 2017+: Transformer architecture (self-attention) revolutionized NLP and later multimodal 
models.
### 1.4 Core concepts & vocabulary
‚Ä¢ Data ‚Äî the raw input: images, text, sensor readings, tabular rows.

‚Ä¢ Features ‚Äî inputs derived from raw data that the model uses.

‚Ä¢ Label / Target ‚Äî the variable we want to predict (supervised learning).

‚Ä¢ Model ‚Äî mathematical function mapping input ‚Üí output.

‚Ä¢ Training ‚Äî process of adjusting model parameters to minimize a loss function.

‚Ä¢ Inference ‚Äî using the trained model to make predictions on new data.

‚Ä¢ Overfitting / Underfitting ‚Äî overfitting: model fits noise; underfitting: model too simple.

‚Ä¢ Generalization ‚Äî ability of a model to perform well on unseen data.
### 1.5 Types of machine learning
‚Ä¢ Supervised learning: Learn from labeled examples (classification, regression).

‚Ä¢ Unsupervised learning: Discover structure in unlabeled data (clustering, dimensionality 
reduction).

‚Ä¢ Semi-supervised learning: Mix of labeled + unlabeled data (useful when labels are 
sparse).

‚Ä¢ Self-supervised learning: Creates supervisory signals from raw data (very important in 
modern LLMs).

‚Ä¢ Reinforcement learning (RL): Agents learn by interacting with an environment and 
receiving rewards.

## 2. What is Generative AI?
### 2.1 Definition
Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) refers to a category of AI systems that can create 
new content ‚Äî such as text, images, music, video, or code ‚Äî that resembles human-made 
output.
Unlike traditional AI, which focuses on recognizing patterns or making predictions from existing 
data, Generative AI models learn the underlying structure of the data and then use this 
knowledge to produce novel examples that share the same characteristics as the training data.

Example:

‚Ä¢ Traditional AI: Given an image, determine if it contains a cat.

‚Ä¢ Generative AI: Given a prompt, create a completely new, realistic image of a cat that has 
never existed before.

<img width="507" height="284" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f45b38f-fdec-4025-94eb-e2b413c058c9" />

### 2.2 How Generative AI Differs from Traditional AI

| Aspect | Traditional AI | Generative AI |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Purpose | Classify or predict | Generate content |
| Output | Labels, predictions | Text, images, audio |
| Examples | Spam detection | ChatGPT, DALL¬∑E |

### 2.3 Core Idea Behind Generative AI
At its heart, Generative AI tries to model the probability distribution of the training data so it 
can sample new data points from this learned distribution.

‚Ä¢ Example: If trained on a dataset of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays, the model learns the style, 
grammar, and vocabulary of Shakespeare‚Äôs writing. When prompted, it can generate 
sentences that mimic his writing style ‚Äî even though those exact sentences were never 
seen in the training set.

### 2.4 Evolution of Generative AI
‚Ä¢ 1980s‚Äì1990s: Early statistical language models and Markov chains for text generation.

‚Ä¢ 2014: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) introduced by Ian Goodfellow 
revolutionized realistic image synthesis.

‚Ä¢ 2017: Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al.) enabled massive improvements in 
sequence modeling.

‚Ä¢ 2018‚Äì2020: Large pre-trained models like BERT, GPT-2, and GPT-3 emerged.

‚Ä¢ 2021‚Äìpresent: Diffusion models, LLMs like GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, and multimodal 
models (text + image + audio).

### 2.5 Types of Data Generated by Generative AI
‚Ä¢ Text: Articles, poetry, stories, code (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, Claude)

‚Ä¢ Images: Photorealistic art, design concepts (e.g., DALL¬∑E, MidJourney)

‚Ä¢ Audio: Music composition, speech synthesis (e.g., OpenAI Jukebox, ElevenLabs)

‚Ä¢ Video: Short animations, deepfake videos

‚Ä¢ 3D Models: Game assets, digital twins

‚Ä¢ Multimodal outputs: Combining text, image, and audio in one generation

### 2.6 Underlying Model Approaches (brief overview)
Generative AI can be built using different model types (explained in later sections):

‚Ä¢ GANs ‚Äî Two networks compete: one generates (Generator) and one judges 
(Discriminator).

‚Ä¢ VAEs ‚Äî Encode data into a compressed representation and then decode it to create 
variations.

‚Ä¢ Diffusion Models ‚Äî Start with random noise and iteratively refine it into structured data.

‚Ä¢ Autoregressive LLMs ‚Äî Predict the next token in a sequence, enabling natural text 
generation

## 3. Types of Generative AI Models

Generative AI can be implemented using several different model architectures, each with unique 
principles and applications. The most influential and widely used are Generative Adversarial 
Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models. Additionally, 
autoregressive transformer-based models are important for text generation.

### 3.1 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

#### Definition & Concept
Introduced in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow, a GAN consists of two neural networks ‚Äî a Generator and 
a Discriminator ‚Äî that compete in a zero-sum game:

‚Ä¢ Generator (G): Creates synthetic data from random noise.

‚Ä¢ Discriminator (D): Judges whether input data is real (from training set) or fake (from 
generator).

The Generator tries to fool the Discriminator, while the Discriminator tries to correctly identify 
fake data. Over time, the Generator learns to produce increasingly realistic samples

#### Architecture Overview
1. Noise Input (z): Random vector fed into Generator.
  
2. Generator Network: Transforms noise into fake data (e.g., an image).
   
3. Discriminator Network: Takes data (real or fake) and outputs a probability of being real.
   
4. Adversarial Training: Both networks are trained together with opposite goals.
   
#### Strengths
‚Ä¢ Produces highly realistic images.

‚Ä¢ No explicit probability distribution modeling needed.

#### Weaknesses
‚Ä¢ Training instability (mode collapse).

‚Ä¢ Sensitive to hyperparameters.
#### Applications
‚Ä¢ Photorealistic face generation (This Person Does Not Exist).

‚Ä¢ Super-resolution (upscaling low-resolution images).

‚Ä¢ Style transfer in art.

### 3.2 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
#### Definition & Concept
A VAE is a probabilistic generative model based on autoencoders, introduced in 2013‚Äì2014.
It learns a compressed latent representation of the data and can generate new samples by 
decoding points from this latent space.
#### Architecture Overview
1. Encoder: Maps input data into a latent vector (mean and variance).
   
2. Latent Space Sampling: Samples from the learned probability distribution (usually 
Gaussian).

3. Decoder: Reconstructs the data from the latent vector.
The ‚Äúvariational‚Äù aspect comes from enforcing the latent space to follow a known distribution, 
enabling smooth interpolation between points
#### Strengths
‚Ä¢ Latent space is interpretable and continuous.

‚Ä¢ Good for controlled content generation.
Weaknesses

‚Ä¢ Outputs tend to be blurrier than GANs for images.
#### Applications
‚Ä¢ Image and video reconstruction.

‚Ä¢ Semi-supervised learning.

‚Ä¢ Data compression.

### 3.3 Diffusion Models
#### Definition & Concept
Diffusion models generate data by starting with pure noise and progressively denoising it into 
structured data.

They learn to reverse a diffusion process:

‚Ä¢ Forward process: Gradually adds noise to training data until it becomes pure noise.

‚Ä¢ Reverse process: Learns to remove noise step-by-step to recover clean data
#### Architecture Overview
‚Ä¢ Often based on U-Net structures with attention layers.

‚Ä¢ Uses a noise scheduler to control the generation process
#### Strengths
‚Ä¢ Produces extremely high-quality and detailed images.

‚Ä¢ Stable training compared to GANs.
#### Weaknesses
‚Ä¢ Slow generation (many denoising steps).
#### Applications
‚Ä¢ DALL¬∑E 2, Stable Diffusion, Imagen.

‚Ä¢ Photorealistic image synthesis.

‚Ä¢ Image inpainting and editing.
### 3.4 Autoregressive Models for Generation (Brief Mention)
Although GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion dominate image generation, autoregressive models are key 
for text and sequence generation.

‚Ä¢ Predict the next token (word, pixel) based on previous tokens.

‚Ä¢ Examples: GPT, PixelRNN, Music Transformer

o Examples: Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), WordPiece.

#### 2. Embedding Layer

o Transforms tokens into dense vector representations.

#### 3. Positional Encoding

o Injects information about token order (since self-attention has no inherent 
sequence notion).
#### 4. Self-Attention Mechanism
o Calculates relationships between all tokens in a sequence.

o Formula:
Attention(Q,K,V)=softmax(QKTdk)V\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = 
\text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)VAttention(Q,K,V)=softmax(dk
14
QKT)V
where Q = Queries, K = Keys, V = Values.

#### 5. Feed-Forward Networks
o Fully connected layers applied to each token independently.

#### 6. Residual Connections & Layer Normalization
o Help stabilize and speed up training.

#### 7. Stacking Layers
o Dozens to hundreds of layers for deep understanding.

#### 8. Output Layer
o Predicts the next token (autoregressive) or masked token (bidirectional).

### 5.3 Types of Transformer-based LLMs
‚Ä¢ Autoregressive (Decoder-only) ‚Äî GPT series, LLaMA (good for generation).

‚Ä¢ Encoder-only ‚Äî BERT (good for classification, understanding).

‚Ä¢ Encoder‚ÄìDecoder ‚Äî T5, BART (good for translation, summarization).

### 6.1 Training Process of LLMs
